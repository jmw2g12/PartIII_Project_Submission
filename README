Investigating New Strategies to Effectively Play the Board Game Blokus
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the source code used in my Part III project as detailed
in my submitted report.

The Java Application can be used to play the game using either the command line
interface or various computer opponents to control the moves. This will also
create playing data to test the learning process. Compile the application and
run it a few times, move the playing data folder to the "Data Processing"
directory. From here run the script that processes the playing data to create
training data. Then open Matlab and follow the instructions to make a network
and its Java class. This Java class can then be used back in the Java
Application or Web Application.

A web server can be started to play versus the computer or other human
opponents. The files in "Java Application" and "Web Application/src" are
identical, aside from the Blokus and WebPlayer classes.

Each folder will have a README file to further explain how to use its contents.
