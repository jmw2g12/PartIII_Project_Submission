Data Management
---------------

To show how a game panned out from the move list alone, call the game simulator
using "node game_simulator.js <moves file>".

E.g. node game_simulator.js playing_data/sample_moves.txt



To process training data from move files, call the playing data processor using
"node process_playing_data.js <moves directory>".

This will create a folder in this directory called "training_data" with the
files numbered. This data can the be dealt with via the Matlab scripts.

E.g. node process_playing_data.js playing_data/
